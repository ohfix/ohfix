# Overview and Definitions

* JavaScript types can be divided into two categories: primitive types and object types. JavaScriptâ€™s primitive types include numbers, strings of text (known as strings), and Boolean truth values (known as booleans). A significant portion of this blog is dedicated to a detailed explanation of the numeric, Boolean and string types in JavaScript.
* The special JavaScript values null and undefined are primitive values, but they are not numbers, strings, or booleans. Each value is typically considered to be the sole member of its own special type.
* Any JavaScript value that is not a number, a string, a boolean, a symbol, null or undefined is an object. An object (that is, a member of the type object) is a collection of properties where each property has a name and a value (either a primitive value or another object).
