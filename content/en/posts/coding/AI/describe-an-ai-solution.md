**Describe an AI solution that you are interested in.**

**Descriptions should be made in terms of**

> #### **What is the purpose of the AI solution?**

#### AI solution in Sales:

* What is the purpose of the AI solution? AI in Sales provide solutions from marketing, customer access, Consulting, closing, automatic after-sales care with low cost and high efficiency.


* AI can handle data more than humans:

  Currently, sellers use their work experience and available economic models. Decisions are made based on the small amount of input data. However, AI can learn to adapt to each change or to a huge amount of input data to make a personalized decision for each customer. Humans handle 10 items of information simultaneously, but with AI it is possible to aggregate up to 1000 information in seconds to make a decision.
* AI can operate 24/7

  Humans can operate in circadian rhythms but not with computers. There are customers who need during special times, AI can provide quick support.
* AI finds many potential customers

  With the ability to analyze big data, AI is superior to humans in finding new potential customers. A customer needs a product on Google, AI can recognize and give suggestions to customers for the product in need.
* Honest
  * AI is a human product, so it is possible to set rules and limits for the machine. Humans can be for personal gain but AI is not, this will avoid losing customers from personal reasons.


  * For example, the e-commerce industry has a rating tool to recommend to customers, if people do it, it is difficult to make a choice about which products are better and also heavily influenced by personal views. AI is very transparent in these tasks.


* Track customer care

  AI can manage old customers effectively. 1 million old customers are not a problem with AI. It can give seller reminder or auto-care based on the appropriate sizes. This will greatly reduce costs and maximize the potential that old customers bring.
* Is a smart competition tool

  Not only with customers, but AI can also offer suitable business models and marketing campaigns to compete directly with competitors. Imagine that one day your company A will be offered a summer promotion by a competitor B, the business models cannot cover all the cases. Do you then have to use experience to make competitive decisions that are full of risk? But if there is AI, with the data collected tracking analysis from competitors, it can completely produce a quick list of reports including potential revenue, competitor profits, the number of customers approaching based on specific figures. Based on this information, business owners may have a basis to make competitive decisions in the most appropriate way.
* E-commerce floor - AI is emerging
  * **Beecost**, is a large data tracking platform of Vietnam e-commerce exchanges. From the data collected **Beecost** will suggest and give advice to users on where to buy, when. This directly affects competition so the current AI is really a very important thing


  * **Alibaba**, **eBay**, **Tiki** have also been applying AI in exploiting hundreds of millions of products to give suggestions to customers. This certainly cannot be used by humans to handle such large volumes. AI processes all information based on specific bases and models so it can be trusted.

> #### **Why do you think it is intelligent?**

* In short, AI is smart because it has the ability to collect data, process large volumes of data, deduce data and is not affected by current emotions and make decisions quickly.
* The purpose of AI in Sales is to increase work efficiency, increase user experience, reduce costs.

##### The potential of AI in Sales is enormous and the demand is entirely possible in the future. So I hope through this course I can visualize more clearly so that someday AI in sales will be available in the AI application market in the future.
